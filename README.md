# MarvelComics
The MarvelComics app is my first **TDD project** built by following along the different blog posts of Jon Reid, from Quality Coding.
Jon Reid explains how does TDD works and influences code design, by going himself through the creation of this MarvelComis app.
This repository is a simple training exercice from myself to replicate the app while applying TDD as per Jon's guidance.

##Experience
The objectives of this project are:
- to get familiar with Test Driven Development
- see how to apply TDD in a real project by "shadowing" an expert
- try to pre-write tests and production code before comparing it with Jon's code
- apply the learnings in my own apps by refactoring one entirely
